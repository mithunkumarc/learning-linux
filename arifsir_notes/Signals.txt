signal handling : IPC 

eg: process did something(exception/error)
	generate signals 
	
	SIGFPE(8) floating point error 
	
SIGNALs are given to process 

A process wants to do another process something

eg : ctrl+c sigint(2)

show all signals list
>kill -l
>man 7 signal 


catchable and non catchable

sigkill : no process can catch and
sigstop 

>kill pid
>killall <processname>


>kill %jobid


trap command?
customize signal/message?
or behavior?
user defined handler(signal)?
